# DRM3 Core Tenets

These fundamental principles constitute the core of DRM3's mission. They are interrelated and form integral parts of a comprehensive framework that underpins efficient data economies.

## Sovereignty

*Sovereignty* in the realm of data signifies the absolute ownership and control that individuals or entities possess over the data they generate and provide. It encompasses several key principles:

- *Ownership:* Sovereignty entails genuine ownership of data, where individuals or entities serve as the indisputable source of truth for their data.
- *Access Control:* It bestows the power to grant or revoke access to one's data, ensuring that data sharing occurs on one's own terms.
- *Commercialization:* Sovereignty grants the right to commercialize one's data, enabling individuals or entities to derive benefits from its use.
- *Licensing Control:* It confers control over how data is licensed, enabling the determination of terms and conditions for its usage.

Sovereignty also encompasses resistance to censorship, ensuring that data cannot be arbitrarily restricted or censored. To illustrate this concept, consider a USB drive where you exercise complete ownership and control. Similarly, envision a USB drive connected to a LAN under your administration, where you have authority over the Access Control List (ACL). Sovereignty extends this level of control to decentralized networks, like DRM3, making it the antithesis of traditional cloud-based models. In essence, sovereignty empowers individuals and entities to become the ultimate custodians of their data.

## Privacy

*Privacy* emphasizes the protection and confidentiality of personal and sensitive data:

- *Data Protection:* Privacy ensures the safeguarding of personal information and sensitive data from unauthorized access or misuse.
- *User Consent:* It respects individuals' rights to determine how their data is collected, used, and shared, requiring informed consent for data processing.
- *Data Anonymity:* Privacy involves measures to anonymize data when necessary to protect individuals' identities.

Decentralized technology is indispensable for preserving data sovereignty, ensuring privacy, facilitating ownership, granting control over monetization, and resisting censorship. It empowers data owners to reclaim authority over their data and ensures that they are not merely providers of licensable content and data exchange but true guardians of their digital assets.

## Equitability

*Equitability* embodies the concept that for data to be maximally utilized, all participants must operate on equal footing, relative to the value they create and consume. The notion that data is typically utilized to only 10% of its potential capacity, similar to our brain's utilization, can be attributed to various factors, with equitability being a significant contributor. To keep an engine running efficiently, all components must function at 100% capacity, with the presence of fuel and the ability to fine-tune the engine. In a data ecosystem, all components, from origin and source to consumption and utility, collectively define how we interact with data and leverage it to enhance our lives. Equitability is inseparable from transparency.

## Transparency

*Transparency* pertains to the visibility of data. It encompasses understanding where data originates, its source, destination, transformations it undergoes, who accesses it, and how it is utilized. Transparency holds critical importance for data privacy. Presently, the term "data privacy" is somewhat misleading, as we often relinquish our data rights in exchange for free services, and have no insight into who is consuming it, or how it is being monetized. Without transparency, it becomes impossible to ascertain equitability within the data ecosystem.


# Empowering the Data Ecosystem

The core tenets of DRM3, including Sovereignty, Privacy, Equitability, and Transparency, represent a vision for data ecosystems where individuals and enterprising entities have control, fairness, and transparency over their data. However, the journey to realizing these principles can be challenging. It requires overcoming technical complexities, navigating legal and ethical landscapes, and developing the necessary tools for implementation.

## DRM3's Mission

DRM3's mission is to bridge this gap by making these fundamental principles easily accessible to the builders, creators, and consumers of data and content. We understand that while the concept of data sovereignty, privacy, equitability, and transparency is groundbreaking, it remains out of reach for many due to its complexity.

**Turning Vision into Reality**

To bring this vision to life, DRM3 is committed to simplifying and democratizing access to these principles with:

- **User-Friendly Interfaces (UI):** Intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that empower individuals and organizations to exercise sovereignty over their data, and fine tune their data engines, allowing users to manage access, control licensing, and protect their privacy without the need for specialized DLT expertise.

- **SDK Tooling:** For developers and creators, DRM3 is developing Software Development Kits (SDKs) that streamline the integration of decentralized technologies into applications and services. These SDKs facilitate the implementation of data sovereignty and privacy features, making it accessible to a wider range of developers.

- **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts on decentralized networks play a pivotal role in enabling transparent and automated data transactions. DRM3 is committed to providing easy-to-use smart contract templates that can be customized to suit specific data use cases.  A "TrustSwap" for data ecosystems.

**Empowering Builders and Creators**

DRM3 envisions a future where builders and creators, regardless of their technical background, seamlessly integrate data sovereignty, privacy, equitability, and transparency into their projects. This empowerment extends beyond technology to encompass licensing, ethics, and legal aspects, ensuring that individuals and entrepreneurial entities possess the knowledge and tools to efficiently and confidently engage with and harness the collective value contribution to the data economy, resulting in equitable and representative rewards.

DRM3's mission transcends mere promotion of principles; it's about transforming these principles into accessible and pragmatic solutions. Through the provision of user-friendly interfaces, SDK tooling, and smart contracts, collectively referred to as "enablement tooling," DRM3 empowers individuals, creators, and consumers to actively participate in a data ecosystem that safeguards their rights and values. This endeavor paves the way for a digital future that is more equitable, transparent, and inclusive for all.
